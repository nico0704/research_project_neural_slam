# Final Steps for finalizing research project PIN-SLAM

## Visualization
- [X] Visualizing SLAM algorithm with new gui (neural map and/or mesh)
- [X] Prepare mesh navigation for visu hsfd campus
- [ ] Visualizing mesh navigation on generated mesh by PIN-SLAM
- [ ] Visualize Loop Closures?

## Setup and Execution Doc + Scripts
- [X] Write setup and execution readme and/or scripts for PIN-SLAM with hsfd
- [X] Write setup and execution readme and/or scripts for mesh navigation with hsfd
- [X] Optional: Bring PIN-SLAM results and mesh navigation stack together

## PIN-SLAM Advanced
- [ ] Read paper again and understand
- [ ] Document most important configs
- [ ] Analysis of PIN-SLAM on hsfd: FPS, Mesh Quality, Hardware Util, PIN Map Size, Loop Closures, Time Details

## Presentation

## Optional Lidar Rec Test
- [ ] Scan own env with helm and measure!
